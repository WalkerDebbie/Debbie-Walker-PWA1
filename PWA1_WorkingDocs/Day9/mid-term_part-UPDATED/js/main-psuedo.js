//step 1: create a method window.onload  using: *function init(){} **Ref:Day7/CHAP 9**
            // this tells the browser to wait until page is fully loaded OR wrapping a variable into a method to call it will force the DOM to recognize this first

//step 2: declare a variable to hold Element Id by using: var button = document.getElementById("");**Ref:Day7/CHAP 9**

//step 3: declare global object variables containing arrays for "name" "address" "GPA" and "GPA average" **Ref:Day6/car-o-matic** you create an object variable using this syntax var name = { keyIdentifier : value }

//step 4: create a function called "studentData()"

    //EMBEDDED (step 5-12) INSIDE OF studentData() FUNCTION...

    //step 5: declare local math variables that iterate through an array and invokes a value when the onclick function is called

    //step 6: declare global variables for a for loop "for(var i=0; i<0; i=++){})" using: var i = 0; and var GPA = [array goes here]; - these will hold the values that the function "studentDataBase" will invoke

    //step 7: iterate over the object/array using a for loop: for(var i=0; i<0; i=++){}

    //step 8: declare a variable called "htmlFunction = document.getElementById("name"); and htmlFunction.innerHTML to call/pull the html into the js

    //step 9: create an "if statement" (i === students.name.length - 1){} which means if i is absolutely the index is equal to two, but the length is equal to three, you minus one, which loops until it meets the required index/keys

    //step 10: break

    //step 11: else statement ++1

    //step 12: break

//step 6: tell js to call "showAnswer" event handle...when user clicks on button using: onclick="studentData()"; with a value="next" **Ref:Day7/CHAP 9**

//step 8: console.log

//step 9: document.write
